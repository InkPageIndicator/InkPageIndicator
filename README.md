InkPageIndicator is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

```ogdl
github "Tyler/InkPageIndicator"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `InkPageIndicator.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "git@github.com:kimtaesu/InkPageIndicator.git.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```
